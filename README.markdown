hackedGaudi
===========

Gaudi ported to [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org).

Targets include builds for Neko VM, C++, Java, PHP and JavaScript. The JavaScript build is part of the hackedGaudi Online project 
which attempts to bring the build tool to the browser; integrating with JavaScript libraries jQuery, Socket.IO and Bootstrap and Node.js 
for system integration with a MongoDB (or Redis?) backend for storage.
